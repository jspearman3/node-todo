In addition to food name and price, I added a quantity so if Emeril wanted more items than one, he could store that information without adding multiple instances of that item. The total cost is updated to include the quantity.

Additionally, adding a food item to the database with the same name and price as an existing entry will overwrite the existing entry's quantity. This was done, again to eliminate multiple entries. I left the option open of having two differently priced items of the same name to give Emeril more flexibility if he wanted to have a more expensive version of a type of food.

The only other additional things added were UI changes, where the avaliable food in the database was shown in a cleaner table format with a remove button instead of a checkbox. This makes the interface more intuitive
